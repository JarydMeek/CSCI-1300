/*
* Algorithm: First verify that the sequence string is not longer than the genome string
                If it is output 0
                If it isn't check the genome for the sequence moving one letter each time
                    Calculate the sim score for each sequence of letters, if it is better than the previous best, save that as the best.
                output the best
* Input parameters: Two strings, one being the genome to search, and one being the sequence we are searching.
* Output (prints to screen): nothing
* Returns: the best sim score found in the genome.
