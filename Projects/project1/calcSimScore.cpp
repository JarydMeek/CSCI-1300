* Algorithm: First check that the strings are the same length and that they are not 0, if they aren't the same length or one of them is 0, output 0
            Then go letter by letter for the length of the strings comparing the strings to make sure they are the same letter
            if they aren't, add one to a storage variable
            Calculate the simularity score
* Input parameters: Two strings to compare
* Output (prints to screen): nothing
* Returns: similarity score between 0 and 1 in the form of a double
