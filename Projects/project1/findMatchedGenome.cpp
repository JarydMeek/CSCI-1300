/*
* Algorithm: First, verify none of the strings are empty, if they are return given error
             Then, make sure that the three genomes input are the same length, if they aren't return an error
             then find the best sim Score in each of the genomes, using the function above (also from problem 5)
             Compare the best sim score from each genome to find the best overall score, and output response stating which is the best.
* Input parameters: 3 strings of genomes, and 1 string of a sequence to search
* Output (prints to screen): if any of the strings passed to the function are empty, it will output an error
                            if the three genome strings passed are different lengths, it will output an error
                            otherwise, it will output which genome is the best match
* Returns: no return
