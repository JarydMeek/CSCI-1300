* Algorithm: run printMenu to create menu
            accept input and store it.
                If 1 is selected > prompt for input (and store) agility and strength
                If 2 is selected > prompt for input (and store) agility and speed 
                If 3 is selected > prompt for input (and store) strength and speed
                If 4 is selected > quit function and don't output
            Then calculate and output the hireScore
* Input parameters: a number to select something in the menu
                    then a combination of agility, strength, and speed corresponding to selected animal
* Output (prints to screen): menu, prompts for agility, strength, and speed, then calculated hire score
* Returns: nothing
