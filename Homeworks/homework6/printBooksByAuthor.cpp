/*
* Algorithm: take the given input, make sure books are stored in the arrays passed to the function, and if there are, search for and output the books from the author given
* Input parameters: a string containing book names, a string containing authors, an in for the number of books stored, and a string containing the author's name to search for
* Output (prints to screen): the books written by the author given including a special message if there are none by the author, or an error stating that there are no books stored
* Returns: nothing
