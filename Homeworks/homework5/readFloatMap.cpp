/*
* Algorithm: Takes a string and delimiter, and breaks the string into parts on the delimiter, storing the parts in the given array, checks to make sure the parts will fit in the array,
             doesn't count the part if the delimiter is repeated the string, or if the delimiter is at the beginning or end of the string.
* Input parameters: string, character that is the delimiter, an array to store the split parts in, and the size of the given storage array.
* Output (prints to screen): nothing
* Returns: either a -1 if the number of split parts is greater than the size, a zero if the given string is empty, and the number of split parts if neither of the previous are true.
