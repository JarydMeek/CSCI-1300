//SPLIT FROM HOMEWORK 4
/*
* Algorithm: Takes a string and delimiter, and breaks the string into parts on the delimiter, storing the parts in the given array, checks to make sure the parts will fit in the array,
             doesn't count the part if the delimiter is repeated the string, or if the delimiter is at the beginning or end of the string.
* Input parameters: string, character that is the delimiter, an array to store the split parts in, and the size of the given storage array.
* Output (prints to screen): nothing
* Returns: either a -1 if the number of split parts is greater than the size, a zero if the given string is empty, and the number of split parts if neither of the previous are true.

/*
* Algorithm: open file given in the parameters into the file stream
            first check to make sure the starting number of books in the array is less than the storage we are given, if it isn't return -2
            if we can store the number of books given, take the given file, split a line into an string, then split the string on the comma which divides the string into author and book title, 
            then store each part of the book information into different arrays for title and author.
            finally if we can't open the file, return -1
* Input parameters: file to open, an array to store titles in, an array to store authors in, an int for the number of books we need to store, and an int for the size of the storage that we have been passed
* Output (prints to screen): nothing
* Returns: a -2 if the book number we should start reading from is greater than the storage we have, or a -1 if unable to open the file give, otherwise the number of books stored
