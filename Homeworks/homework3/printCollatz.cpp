Algorithm - Determine if the entered value is valid, if it is invalid, return "invalid number"
                as long as the number is above 1 repeat
                    if the number is even
                        divide it by 2 and store the output back into the currentValue variable
                    if it is odd
                        multiply the number by 3 and add 1, then store back into currentValue variable
Input - 1 number in integer form
Output - print each step of the Collatz process, or invalid number if the input is invalid
Returns - no return
