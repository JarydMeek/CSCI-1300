Algorithm - Have the user pick a story and prompt for the correct entries, then create the story
            loop picking stories till 4 is selected
Input - A number to select the story, then the prompted for values
Output - a prompt for whatever story the reader wants, then the words neccesary for the story, then a goodbye message
Returns - no return
