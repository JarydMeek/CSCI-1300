Algorithm - Determine if the year is before or after 1582 (the year that there was a calendar correction)
                If the year is above 1582
                    if it is divisible by 4, set the output to true
                    if it is divisible by 100 and not 400, set the output to false
                If the year is not above 1582
                    if it is divisible by 4, set the output to true
Input - 1 number in integer form, corresponding to a year
Output - no printed output
Returns - return true if the year is a leap year, and false if it is not.
