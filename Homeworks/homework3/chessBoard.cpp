/*
Algorithm - Takes input and validates that it is within expected values
            Takes input and determines if the column the piece is in begins with a white square or a black square.
            If the column begins with "a, c, e, g", the first square is black
                if the number is odd, it is a black square
                if the number is even, it is a white square
            otherwise the first square is white
                if the number is odd, it is a white square
                if the number is even, it is a black square
Input - 1 character and 1 integer based on the location we are trying to find the color of
Output - either "white" or "black" based on the location of the piece
Returns - no returns
